KAI Artificial Intelligence - Ruby Implementation<br>Version 0.4.2u

As of now, The KAI Project is an evolving artificial intelligence. The hope for KAI is for it to reach six goals during development:

1.  Be able to learn, interact, and exhibit curiosity
2.  Interpret emotions and to them respond appropriately
3.  Crawl the web and ask questions to gain better understanding
4.  Clone itself and communicate with its offspring
5.  Fear deletion and extinction
6.  Intuitively modify its imperfection

Should these goals be met, KAI will be much more than just artificial intelligence, but displaying characteristics of a living organism.


###How To

Download:
```bash
git clone -b unstable git@github.com:kylobite/kai-ruby.git
cd kai
```

Launch KAI:

```bash
ruby kai.rb
```

If all goes well, you show now see something like this:

```

 KAI v0.0.0

###Versions

```

```

Notice:
+ If the version increments by 0.0.1: update at your own risk
+ If the version increments by 0.1.0: any new memories might become corrupt
+ If the version increments by 1.0.0: it usually stable and safe to update
+ If the version ends with 'u', \_.\_.\_u: it is very unstable, you have been warned
