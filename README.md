KAI Artificial Intelligence<br>Version 0.3

As of now, The KAI Project is an evolving artificial intelligence. The hope for KAI is for it to reach six goals during development:

1.  Be able to learn, interact, and exhibit curiosity
2.  Interpret emotions and to them respond appropriately
3.  Crawl the web and ask questions to gain better understanding
4.  Clone itself and communicate with its offspring
5.  Fear deletion and extinction
6.  Intuitively modify its imperfection

The current version of KAI can be used to determine what goals have been met and the progress towards the next goal:

```
Version Goal.Progress
```

Should these goals be met, KAI will be much more than just artificial intelligence, but displaying characteristics of a living organism.
