KAI Artificial Intelligence<br>Version 0.3.9

As of now, The KAI Project is an evolving artificial intelligence. The hope for KAI is for it to reach six goals during development:

1.  Be able to learn, interact, and exhibit curiosity
2.  Interpret emotions and to them respond appropriately
3.  Crawl the web and ask questions to gain better understanding
4.  Clone itself and communicate with its offspring
5.  Fear deletion and extinction
6.  Intuitively modify its imperfection

Should these goals be met, KAI will be much more than just artificial intelligence, but displaying characteristics of a living organism.

###Versions

The current version of KAI has three interpretations:

```
Version Goal.Progress.Testing
or
Version Production.Development.Patch
or
Version Release.Beta.Alpha
```

For this reason, if the newest version has only gone up by 0.0.1, update at your own risk. It would be best to at least wait for it to increment by 0.1.0.
